## Installation

### with npm

We assume that you already setup your own working front-end environment and `cd` into it

```bash
cd my-project;
nvm use v22.14.0
``` 

Add the `superfuse-wizard` using your favorite package manager, e.g., with pnpm:

```sh
npm add -D superfuse-wizard
```

Alternatively, you can fork a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install` (or `yarn`), then start a development server:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Ratimon/superfuse-wizard.git
cd superfuse-wizard;
pnpm dev
